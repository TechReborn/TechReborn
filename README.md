# TechReborn 1.9.4 Branch

TechReborn is a resurrection of GregTech 2.78 for modern Minecraft. It brings most of it's features and behaviors to Minecraft, with lots of tweaks, and a few editions. It also aims to be more compatible with other mods than GregTech, and has the ultimate goal of becoming a standalone mod, compatible with, but not dependent on IC2. We have no plans of ever supporting IC2 classic as of now.

TechReborn is currently in a beta state. Crashes or bugs may happen at any time, so *please* do not use this on a world that is important to you, or at the very least back it up on every update.

We have permission to use Greg's textures (see [here](https://i.imgur.com/YQEMrq5.png?1)).

1.9.4:
---

*This version is constantly recieving updates, and does has a semi-stable release. Any 1.9.4 builds (including semi-stable releases) are still subject to change and potentially (though unlikely) could break worlds. Once again, remember to backup your worlds before using any jenkins builds.*

1.8.9:

*This version is not supported at all. Use at your own risk, we won't push a new build with a bugfix no matter what, with the exceptions of pull requests, which we still discourage.*

1.7.10:
---

*Please understand that the 1.7.10 version of TechReborn is not being maintained. We've moved onto TechReborn for Minecraft 1.8.9. If there is an extremely critical bug that you find in the 1.7.10 version, report it to the bug tracker and we will determine if it is drastic enough for a fix.*
