# TechReborn

TechReborn is a ressurection of GregTech 4 for modern Minecraft. It brings most of GT4's features and behaviors to Minecraft, with lots of tweaks, and a few editions. It also aims to be more compatible with other mods than GregTech, and has the ultimate goal of becoming a standalone mod, compatible with but not dependant on IC2.

TechReborn is currently in a pre-alpha state.
