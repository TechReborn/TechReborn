###### Energy

Energy is the cornerstone of Tech Reborn. Machines require energy to
run, the same as any electric machines used IRL.

#### How it Works

At its core, Tech Reborn's energy is very simple. Energy is created by
`![](/mods/techreborn/generator.png)`
**[energy:generators](energy:generators "wikilink")**; passed
through
`![](/mods/techreborn/insulated_copper_cable.png)`
**[energy:cables](energy:cables "wikilink")**; stored in
`![](/mods/techreborn/mfe.png)`
**[energy:batteries](energy:batteries "wikilink")**; and consumed by
machines.

` - Generators produce energy each tick—then they;`\
`   - push energy into any directly connected machines or wire network—or if those are full;`\
`   - store the energy in their own storage`\
` - Cables have an internal buffer (which depends on their tier)—Cables will;`\
`   - empty their buffer into any connected machines (at random)—or if those are full;`\
`   - average out any leftover energy across all connected cables`

The result of this implementation is that energy transfer is
**inefficient over long distances**. To mitigate this, it is best to
place buffers (energy storage blocks) every 10 or 15 blocks to direct
the flow of energy.

#### Energy Tiers

Unlike other tech-based mods, there is no concept of voltage in Tech
Reborn. Instead, energy is divided into categories based on the I/O
capabilities, which translate into the tiers of machinery the player
should be able to construct by that point:

\^ Energy Tier \^ I/O Rate (E/t) \^ Machine Tier \^ Min. Cable
Requirement \| \| Micro \| 8 \| Basic \| Tin \| \| Low \| 32 \| Advanced
\| Tin \| \| Medium \| 128 \| Industrial \| Copper / Insulated Copper \|
\| High \| 512 \| Ultimate \| Gold \| \| Extreme \| 2,048 \| Quantum \|
HV / Insulated HV \| \| Insane \| 8,192 \| - \| Glass Fiber \| \|
Infinite \| 2,147,483,647 \| Creative \| - \|

#### Compatibility

* 1.14 and above use `[`Energy`](https://github.com/TechReborn/Energy "wikilink")\
* 1.12.2 and below is compatible with `[`Forge Energy`](energy:forge_energy "wikilink")`, `[`EU`](energy:eu "wikilink")` and `[`RF`](energy:rf "wikilink")
