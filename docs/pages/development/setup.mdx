` - In the command window that opnes type: "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace idea" without the quotes ``{{gallery>:setup_2.png?lightbox}}`\
` - Press enter and wait for the proccess to finish, this could take some time. The time will depend of your computer power and internet speed. It is also a **lot** slower if it your first time using gradle. ``{{gallery>:setup_3.png?lightbox}}`\
` - Next you want to open Intelij and press on open. This may be located in the file menu at the top. You will want to select the .ipr file, to ensure idea finds the required project files.``{{gallery>:setup_4.png?lightbox}}`\
