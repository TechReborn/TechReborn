###### Wiki guideline for editors

First of all, thank you for your efforts to make this wiki better.
Seriously, with a lot of blocks and items it is near to impossible for
developers to keep wiki up-to-date. \\\\

##### Wiki Structure

In order to have breadcrumbs we have 3 major sections: Items, Blocks and
Energy. While Energy section contains information about blocks it
servers purpose to not bloat Blocks section too much. This approach
introduce kind of burden to create page for a particular block or item
twice. First page - with content with one of above mentioned major
section. Second page is redirect required by plugins used to help with
items and recipes.

##### MC specific plugins

import Mcitem from '/src/mcitem.mdx'
import Recipe from '/src/recipe.mdx'

Couple words about these specific plugins we use:

1\) Minecraft item plugin allows you to insert fancy link to block or
item. Syntax: `<mcitem>``namespace:item_name"/>
namespace is either \"minecraft\" for vanilla items or \"techreborn\"
for TR items and in general stands from mod name. \\\\ item_name is a
registry name for an item. Same as in .json recipes, for example. Or in
advanced tooltip withing MC. \\\\ Plugin will automatically generate
link to a page like mods:techreborn:item_name. That page should have
redirect to a page with real content. Redirect syntax for items is:
`~~REDIRECT>items:item_name~~` Replace \"items\" with \"blocks\" or
\"energy\" to redirect to a proper section.

2\) Minecraft recipe plugin Syntax:
<Recipe recipe="` size 1x1 input minecraft:cobblestone output minecraft:stone tool minecraft:furnace `"/>
where size and tool are optional
