This guide is intended for people wishing to help with the creation of

##### Requirements

* Java Development Kit version 8 (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)`\
* Intelij Idea, you can also use eclipse but that isn't covered. (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)`\
* Git (https://git-scm.com/download/win)`\
* This guide covers MS Windows setup. Sorry.`
