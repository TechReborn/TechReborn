###### Resin Basin {#resin_basin}

The \*\*Resin Basin\*\* is a simple automation tool that is used to
automate the gathering of sap from rubber trees. In order to use the
Resin Basin, you must place it directly onto a TR rubber tree. It will
then begin harvesting any sap directly up or below the log it\'s
currently on (including log it\'s on).

It has an internal buffer of one harvest before becoming full. Once
full, the sap can be withdrawn by placing a storage container
underneath(chest, storage unit, etc). It has a 40% chance to yield two
sap instead of one.

Note, it does not increase the spawn rate of the rubber on the tree, yet
it acts as a basic form to automate collection of rubber instead of
manually tapping, in a sense it\'s meant to be a set and forget type of
machine.

The basin does not require an energy source.

Introduced in the 1.16 version of Tech Reborn
