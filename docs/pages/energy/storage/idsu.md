###### Interdimensional SU

The **Interdimensional SU** can be used to transfer energy between
dimensions. It works like Ender Chest but for energy. All
**Interdimensional SU** blocks placed by same player share same
energy. It is an Insane Tier machine with an input and output rate of
8192 Energy/tick and an internal storage of 1000M Energy.
**Interdimensional SU** accepts energy from all sides except dotted
one, and provides energy from dotted side.

##### Usage

It is used as part of energy network which provides energy concentration
from several sources, energy output via dotted side and ability to
charge items put into it. Main advantage of **IDSU** is ability to
get energy in one dimension and output energy in another place or
dimension.
