###### AESU

The \*\*AESU\*\* aka Adjustable SU is an energy storage with adjustable
output rate. It also charge items which use energy to function, for
example, the
`<mcitem>`{=html}techreborn:red_cell_battery`</mcitem>`{=html}. It is an
Insane tier machine with an input rate of 8192 Energy/tick, an internal
storage of 100M Energy and output rate from 64 E\\t to 8192 E\\tick.
\*\*AESU\*\* accepts energy from all sides except dotted one, and
provides energy from dotted side.

##### Usage

It is used as part of energy network which provides energy concentration
from several sources, energy output via dotted side and ability to
charge items put into it.

Besides that it is used to craft the following recipe:
