###### LESU

The **LESU** or Lapotronic Energy Storage Unit can be used to store
energy and charge items which use energy to function. For example, the
<Mcitem id="techreborn:electric_treetap"/>. LESU
block can store up to 1M energy with 32 E\\t input and 5 E\\t output.
Input and output rates could be improved by building multiblock machine
from **LESU** and adjusted **LESU Storage** blocks. **LESU**
accepts energy from all sides except dotted one, and provides energy
from dotted side.

##### Recipe

`<recipe>` input air techreborn:lv_transformer air input
techreborn:advanced_circuit techreborn:lsu_storage
techreborn:advanced_circuit input air techreborn:mv_transformer air
output techreborn:lapotronic_su `</recipe>`

##### Usage

While LESU itself is not very impressive the true power comes by adding
`![LESU Storage](/mods/techreborn/lsu_storage.png)`
**[LESU Storage](energy:storage:lesu_block "wikilink")** to form a
multiblock structure. Each **LESU Storage** will contribute
additional 1M energy to LESU and additional 1 E\\t to I\\O rates.

While output rate will grow linear, input rate has a little bit
different logic. If multiblock has at least 32 **LESU Storage**
blocks connected input rate will increase to 128 E\\t and if multiblock
structure has at least 128 **LESU Storage** blocks connected input
rate will increase to 512 E\\t. Between these numbers it will increase
linear, same as output rate.
