##### Sphalerite Ore

- Sphalerite ore** is a common ore found in The Nether on layers
        10-126. It will drop
        <Mcitem id="techreborn:sphalerite_dust"/> if
        mined normally, and block itself if mined with Silk Touch
        enchant. Besides that it might drop
        <Mcitem id="techreborn:yellow_garnet"/> with
        12% chance. Dust amount and chance to drop gem both affected by
        Fortune enchant.
