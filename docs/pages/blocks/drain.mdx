###### Drain

The **Drain** is a simple contraption that is used to automate the
gathering of fluid (Mostly water). It works in a simple fashion, any
source fluid directly above it is put into its internal tank (Can only
hold a bucket worth of liquid). This can then be pumped out, either by
machines or tank units (All sides output besides of course the top of
it).

This is particularly useful for 2x2 infinite water ponds, simply place
the drain under one of the source blocks and watch it drain away. You
should probably place a tank underneath the drain and configure it to
pull from the drain above it using the interface of the tank.

It does not require an energy source nor consumes anything, it\'s
entirely gravity-based.

Introduced in the 1.15 version of Tech Reborn
