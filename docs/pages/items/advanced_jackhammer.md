        available from TechReborn. It has 100k energy storage. One can
        charge it using energy storage blocks, like

        Jackhammer could be used as a replacement for pickaxe to break
        stone based blocks, like
        `<mcitem>`{=html}minecraft:stone`</mcitem>`{=html} or
        `<mcitem>`{=html}minecraft:cobblestone`</mcitem>`{=html} with a
        speed of a Diamond Pickaxe. **Advanced Jackhammer** is
        capable of 3x3 mining when set to active. It will cost 100
        energy to break one block. It has iron mining level so most of
        ores could be mined by **Advanced Jackhammer** but with very
        low speed, nevertheless AoE mining will skip non-stone blocks.
