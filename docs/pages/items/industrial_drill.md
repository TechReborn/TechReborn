        It can do AOE mining in 3x3 area. It has 1.000.000 Energy
        storage. One can charge it using
        `<mcitem>`{=html}techreborn:battery_box`</mcitem>`{=html}. Dig
        time doesn\'t depend on amount of blocks being brake and
        calculated for targeted block. Drill will break adjacent blocks
        if their break time less or no more than 10 times harder to
        break target block with pickaxe or shovel. So if you are hitting

        **Industrial Drill** will break adjacent
        `<mcitem>`{=html}minecraft:stone`</mcitem>`{=html} but not
