###### Cloaking Device

A **Cloaking Device** is capable of hiding a player when placed in
one\'s chest slot. It can store up to 40M Energy units. It does not
provide any armour points therefore it will not provide additional
protection. While the device is on, it will make you invisible to other
players and mobs, however mobs will still get agressive if you come too
close to them. Usage cost is 10E/tick (200E/sec, 12KE/min and 720KE/hour
accordingly). Its charge/discharge rate is 8192E/t which means it will
fully charge/discharge in â‰ˆ 4 minutes if Adjustable or Interdimensional
SU is used.
