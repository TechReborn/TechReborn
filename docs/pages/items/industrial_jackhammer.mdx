-   -   Industrial Jackhammer** is a top tier JackHammer item
        available from Tech Reborn. It has 1M energy storage. One can
        charge it using energy storage blocks, like
        `<mcitem>`{=html}techreborn:battery_box`</mcitem>`{=html}.
        Jackhammer could be used as a replacement for pickaxe to break
        stone based blocks, like
        `<mcitem>`{=html}minecraft:stone`</mcitem>`{=html} or
        `<mcitem>`{=html}minecraft:cobblestone`</mcitem>`{=html} with a
        4x speed of a Diamond Pickaxe. **Industrial Jackhammer** is
        capable of 3x3 and 5x5 AoE mining when set to active. It will
        cost 150 energy to break one block. It has iron mining level so
        most of ores could be mined by **Industrial Jackhammer** but
        with very low speed, nevertheless AoE mining will skip non-stone
        blocks.
