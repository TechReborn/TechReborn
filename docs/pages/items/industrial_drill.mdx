=======Industrial Drill=======

- Industrial Drill** is a most powerfull drill in Tech Reborn.
        It can do AOE mining in 3x3 area. It has 1.000.000 Energy
        storage. One can charge it using
        <Mcitem id="techreborn:battery_box"/>. Dig
        time doesn\'t depend on amount of blocks being brake and
        calculated for targeted block. Drill will break adjacent blocks
        if their break time less or no more than 10 times harder to
        break target block with pickaxe or shovel. So if you are hitting
        <Mcitem id="minecraft:sand"/> then
        **Industrial Drill** will break adjacent
        <Mcitem id="minecraft:stone"/> but not
        <Mcitem id="minecraft:obsidian"/>.
