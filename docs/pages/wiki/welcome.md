###### Welcome to your new DokuWiki {#welcome_to_your_new_dokuwiki}

Congratulations, your wiki is now up and running. Here are a few more
tips to get you started.

Enjoy your work with DokuWiki,\\\\ \-- the developers

##### Create your first pages {#create_your_first_pages}

Your wiki needs to have a start page. As long as it doesn\'t exist, this
link will be red: [:start](:start "wikilink").

Go on, follow that link and create the page. If you need help with using
the syntax you can always refer to the [syntax
page](wiki:syntax "wikilink").

You might also want to use a sidebar. To create it, just edit the
[:sidebar](:sidebar "wikilink") page. Everything in that page will be
shown in a margin column on the side. Read our [FAQ on
sidebars](doku>faq:sidebar "wikilink") to learn more.

Please be aware that not all templates support sidebars.

##### Customize your Wiki {#customize_your_wiki}

Once you\'re comfortable with creating and editing pages you might want
to have a look at the [configuration
settings](this>doku.php?do=admin&page=config "wikilink") (be sure to
login as superuser first).

You may also want to see what [plugins](doku>plugins "wikilink") and
[templates](doku>templates "wikilink") are available at DokuWiki.org to
extend the functionality and looks of your DokuWiki installation.

##### Join the Community {#join_the_community}

DokuWiki is an Open Source project that thrives through user
contributions. A good way to stay informed on what\'s going on and to
get useful tips in using DokuWiki is subscribing to the
[doku\>newsletter](doku>newsletter "wikilink").

The [DokuWiki User Forum](http://forum.dokuwiki.org "wikilink") is an
excellent way to get in contact with other DokuWiki users and is just
one of the many ways to get [support](doku>faq:support "wikilink").

Of course we\'d be more than happy to have you [getting
involved](doku>teams:getting_involved "wikilink") with DokuWiki.
