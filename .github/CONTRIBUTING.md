First of all, thank you for your efforts in contributing to TechReborn project 

In order to ease code review of your pull request, please, go through this checklist. 

 * The code compiles.
 * The code has been developer-tested.
 * The code includes javadoc where appropriate. 
 * The code is tidy (indentation, line length, no commented-out code, no spelling mistakes, etc). 
 * Proper use of exceptions has been considered. It is fine to throw an exception during init.
 * Proper side usage (client vs server)
 * Logging is used appropriately. Please, do not spam log files
 * Unused imports are eliminated.
 * Warnings produced by the IDE are eliminated.
 * Are there any leftover stubs or test routines in the code? 
 * Are there any hardcoded, development only things still in the code? 
 * Was performance considered? 
 * Corner cases well documented or any workarounds for a known limitation of the MC, Fabric, RC, etc used.
